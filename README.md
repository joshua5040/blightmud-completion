# blightmud-completion
Blightmud tab completion plugin

## Features
- Filepath completion for the '/load' command.
- Completion on the last 100 lines of the mud output.

Note: This plugin locks completions so the default Blightmud completions will not work.

## Planned Features
- Context-aware completions for all Blightmud commands.
- Settings to change the mud output buffer length and enable/disable specific completions.

## Installation
In Blightmud:
'/add_plugin https://github.com/joshua5040/blightmud-completion.git'
